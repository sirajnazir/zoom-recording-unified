# Google Drive Processing Results Summary

## ‚úÖ Processing Complete
- **370 recordings** processed successfully using `scripts/process-drive-unified.js`
- Each recording folder appears as **exactly ONE row** (duplicate issue fixed!)
- All files within each folder are properly grouped together

## üìä Key Findings from Sheet Verification

### 1. **All 370 Recordings Processed**
- Drive Import - Raw: 370 rows
- Drive Import - Standardized: 370 rows  
- 100% match between discovered folders and processed rows

### 2. **Issues Identified**

#### A. ‚úÖ _B_ Indicator Working Correctly
- All Drive recordings have the `_B_` indicator in their standardized names
- Examples from console output:
  - `Coaching_B_Andrew_Rayaan_Wk13_2024-10-30_M_...`
  - `Coaching_B_Rishi_Aaryan_Wk09_2024-11-01_M_...`
  - `Coaching_B_Rishi_Aaryan_Wk10_2024-11-15_M_...`

#### B. Coach/Student Recognition Issues
- The verification shows "No" as coach for all 370 recordings
- Student column shows numbers instead of actual names
- This suggests the data wasn't properly parsed into the correct columns

#### C. Week Information
- All 370 recordings show "Unknown" week
- Week inference from folder names isn't working properly

### 3. **Positive Results**
- ‚úÖ No duplicate rows (each folder = 1 row)
- ‚úÖ All files properly grouped
- ‚úÖ 100% processing success rate
- ‚úÖ Consistent row count across both tabs

## üîß Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix the _B_ indicator** - All Drive Import recordings should have `_B_` in standardized names
2. **Fix column mapping** - Coach/Student/Week data needs to be properly extracted
3. **Re-run with fixed standardization** after addressing these issues
