# Webhook Download Fallback Implementation

## Overview
Added retry logic for failed webhook downloads that falls back to the Zoom API when webhook download authentication fails.

## Changes Made

### 1. WebhookRecordingAdapter.js
- Added `fallbackToZoomAPI()` method that:
  - Fetches the recording from Zoom API using the recording ID
  - Downloads files using Zoom API bearer token authentication
  - Tracks which downloads used the fallback method
  - Prevents infinite loops with `_fallbackAttempted` flag

- Modified `downloadWebhookRecordingFiles()` to:
  - Check if all downloads failed
  - Specifically check for authentication failures (401/403 status codes)
  - Only trigger fallback for auth-related failures
  - Log detailed download summaries

- Enhanced `processWebhookRecording()` to:
  - Log download summary after attempts
  - Warn when no files are successfully downloaded

### 2. Safety Features
- **Loop Prevention**: Uses `_fallbackAttempted` flag to ensure fallback is only tried once per recording
- **Smart Triggering**: Only attempts fallback for authentication failures (401/403), not for network or server errors
- **Detailed Logging**: Tracks which download method was used for each file
- **Error Preservation**: Maintains original error information while adding fallback metadata

### 3. Test Scripts Created
- `test-webhook-fallback.js`: Basic test for fallback functionality
- `test-webhook-fallback-scenarios.js`: Comprehensive test covering multiple scenarios

## How It Works

1. **Initial Download Attempt**: 
   - Uses webhook access token from the webhook payload
   - Attempts to download all recording files

2. **Failure Detection**:
   - Checks if all downloads failed
   - Identifies authentication failures (401/403 status codes)

3. **Fallback Logic**:
   - If auth failures detected, fetches recording from Zoom API
   - Uses Zoom API bearer token for authentication
   - Downloads files with API credentials

4. **Result Tracking**:
   - Each download result includes `fallback_method` field
   - Logs show which files used fallback
   - Summary statistics for monitoring

## Usage

The fallback is automatic and requires no configuration changes. When webhook downloads fail due to authentication issues, the system will:

1. Log the failure
2. Attempt to fetch via Zoom API
3. Download with API credentials
4. Continue processing normally

## Monitoring

Look for these log messages:
- `"All webhook downloads failed (X auth failures). Attempting fallback to Zoom API..."`
- `"Fallback download complete: X/Y files downloaded successfully"`
- `"Download summary: X/Y files downloaded successfully"`

## Testing

Run the test scripts to verify functionality:
```bash
# Basic test
node scripts/test-webhook-fallback.js

# Comprehensive scenario testing
node scripts/test-webhook-fallback-scenarios.js
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Recordings can still be processed even if webhook auth fails
2. **No Manual Intervention**: Automatic fallback without user action
3. **Detailed Tracking**: Know exactly which method was used for each file
4. **Smart Logic**: Only falls back for auth issues, not other errors
5. **Loop Prevention**: Safe from infinite retry loops
